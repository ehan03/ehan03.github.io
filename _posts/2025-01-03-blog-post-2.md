After years of lurking Kaggle, I finally decided to contribute and upload my first dataset. It contains granular (10 minute increments) historical download bandwidth usage data from Steam broken down by world region and, based on my current knowledge, is the biggest of its kind available to the public since Steam makes it difficult to get historical data. 

Here's the link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehan2025/steam-download-bandwidth-usage-by-world-region/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehan2025/steam-download-bandwidth-usage-by-world-region/).
