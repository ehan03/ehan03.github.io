Hello!ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Eugene Han** and I'm currently a senior at Yale University pursuing a joint Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts in Statistics.

I'll be joining [Farallon Capital Management](https://www.faralloncapital.com/) after graduation and working on the Labs team, the firm's quantitative research engine. This past summer, I worked as a data science intern at [Point72](https://point72.com/) on the Market Intelligence team where I conducted alternative data signal research and worked on time series forecasting problems for healthcare L/S equity. Prior to that, I interned at [Castleton Commodities International](https://www.cci.com/) and collaborated with other data science/engineering interns to prototype the firm's first GenAI/LLM use cases.

My interests broadly lie in statistical modeling, uncertainty quantification, machine learning, finance, and mixed martial arts (sports betting included).
